**# Amazon Product Review Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis project for the Amazon Product Review Analysis case study, completed as part of the Data Science & Analytics (DSA) Data Analysis Capstone Project.

## Project Overview

As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, an e-commerce analytics solutions company, the goal of this project was to analyze Amazon product and customer review data to derive insights for product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `Amazon case study.csv.csv`. It contains 1,465 rows and 16 columns of scraped Amazon product page information, including product details (name, category, price, discount, ratings) and customer engagement metrics (user reviews, titles, and content).

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for data cleaning, comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PivotTables, sorting, filtering, and ultimately for creating an interactive dashboard.

## Analysis Tasks & Key Questions Addressed

The project addressed the following key analytical questions:

1.  **Average Discount Percentage by Product Category:** Investigated the average discount offered across different product categories.
2.  **Number of Products Listed Under Each Category:** Quantified the product count within each category.
3.  **Total Number of Reviews Per Category:** Summed the total customer reviews for products in each category.
4.  **Products with the Highest Average Ratings:** Identified top-rated products.
5.  **Average Actual Price vs. Discounted Price by Category:** Compared the original pricing with discounted pricing across categories.
6.  **Products with the Highest Number of Reviews:** Highlighted products that have received the most customer feedback.
7.  **Products with a Discount of 50% or More:** Counted products offering substantial discounts.
8.  **Distribution of Product Ratings:** Analyzed the frequency of different rating scores (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, 5.0).
9.  **Total Potential Revenue by Category:** Calculated theoretical revenue based on actual price and review/sales count.
10. **Unique Products Per Price Range Bucket:** Segmented products into different price ranges and counted unique items in each.
11. **Relationship Between Rating and Discount:** Explored how product ratings relate to the level of discount offered.
12. **Products with Fewer than 1,000 Reviews:** Identified products with low review engagement.
13. **Categories with Highest Discounts:** Determined which categories feature products with the largest discounts.
14. **Top 5 Products by Combined Rating and Review Count:** Identified top-performing products based on a composite score considering both ratings and review volume.
